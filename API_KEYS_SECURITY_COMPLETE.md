# 🔒 API Keys Security Implementation Complete

## ✅ **SECURITY STATUS: FULLY SECURE**

All API keys have been successfully moved to environment variables only. No hardcoded credentials remain in the codebase.

## 🔧 **What Was Done:**

### **1. Removed All Hardcoded API Keys**
- **Groq API Key**: Removed from `groq_integration.py`
- **Azure Speech API Key**: Removed from `azure_speech_service.py`
- **ElevenLabs API Key**: Removed from `elevenlabs_service.py`
- **All placeholder checks**: Cleaned up hardcoded placeholder validations

### **2. Environment Variables Only**
- **All API keys** now loaded exclusively from `.env` file
- **No fallback hardcoded values** in any service
- **Clean initialization** with proper error handling

### **3. Fixed Emergency Endpoint**
- **Added missing `send_whatsapp_alert` function**
- **Uses environment variables** for Twilio credentials
- **Proper error handling** for missing credentials
